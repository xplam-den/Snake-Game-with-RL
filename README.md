## 🐍 Run the Game

To start playing the game, follow these steps:

1. Open your command prompt or terminal.
2. Change to the directory where you saved `snake_game.py`. For example, if you saved it in a folder called `SnakeRL`, type:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/SnakeRL
   ```
3. Run the game by typing:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```
4. The game will now launch! Use the arrow keys to control the snake.

## ⚙️ Customize Settings

You can personalize your gaming experience. Look for the configuration section in the `snake_game.py` file. Here are some settings you can adjust:

- **Game Speed**: Change how quickly the snake moves.
- **Reward System**: Modify the points earned for eating food.
- **Obstacle Settings**: Add or remove obstacles to increase difficulty.

Explore these options to see how they affect your gameplay!

## 📖 Learn More About Reinforcement Learning

As you play, you might be curious about how the game uses deep learning. Here are some key concepts:

- **Deep Q-Learning**: This algorithm helps the snake learn from its actions. When it eats food, it receives positive feedback, and when it collides with itself or an obstacle, it learns to avoid that path.
- **Neural Networks**: These simulate how humans learn. They help the snake make decisions based on its environment.
- **Dynamic Rewards**: The game offers different points based on current game conditions, making it more challenging for the snake to get smarter.

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

If you run into issues:

- Ensure Python is correctly installed and in your system's PATH.
- Verify that you have all required dependencies. Install missing packages using:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pygame tensorflow
  ```
- Check online forums or the GitHub issues page for common problems and solutions.
